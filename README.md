# PyBer_Analysis
## Overveiw
What is the purpose? To create a multiple-line graph displaying the total weekly fares for each city type. We get to see the most profitable and the lowest Fare amounts side by side using a visual graph. We are only looking at the year 2019, the months from January through April. Comparing three city types, Rural, Suburban, and Urban.

## Results
Well with this analysis, it is clear that Urban got the most amount of Fares. Totaling to an outstanding $39,854.38. Comparing that to the Rural area, they only earned $4,327.93. Which is signifigantly less. With this following image, we are able to see the total rides, drivers, and fares in all three cities. As well as getting the Average fareper ride, and driver.

# Summary

From the data we are able to tell what fares are needed in the cities. This graph allows us to see what fares will look like from a week to week bases, depending on the city type. Seeing this can help us decide on what can be done, and how we can help the overall people in the cities. Also, the average fare cost is far higher in the rural areas. In conclusion, we can say that a rural area will need a higher fare, due to the smaller population, and less workers. 

# recommendations

1: Assign your drivers to different city types, based on the locations they live in. Saving them time to drive
2: For the higher population areas, increase the fare charging price, to increase the average wage for workers.
3: When gas costs increase, drivers have to spend more. Slighty adjust the price depending on the month and gas prices.
